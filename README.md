# University of Minnesota, Twin Cities - Honors Thesis

This repo contains code generated for my thesis for graduation with summa cum laude status. Developed individually with feedback from Professor Gary Oehlert (http://users.stat.umn.edu/~gary/) in the Department of Statistics. Presented to Professors R.D. Cook, PhD (http://users.stat.umn.edu/~rdcook/) and Beth Virnig, PhD & MPH (https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/beth-virnig) for approval of honors graduation status.

Thesis guidelines can be found here: https://honors.umn.edu/current-students/thesis-guide.

If interested in reviewing my methods, you would need to download the excel file of the data and then either of the .R code files from above. The code file with "submitted" in the naming convention has cleaner code commentary and less snippets of code that were for testing purposes during the thesis research and development process. 

If you have questions on this study/analysis - feel free to contact me at perry520@umn.edu. Thanks!
